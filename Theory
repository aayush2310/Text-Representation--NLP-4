We will convert text to number and apply in NLP.
What is feature extraction from text?
=>Ml algo cant understand text,this process of converting text to numbers is called feature extraction/text representation/text vectorisation
Converting image to numbers is easy as we get it already in the form of pixels.
Handling of speech is also easy,as we can get a amplitude curve or graph and plot it,then we can get the amplitude at various points and thus we have obtained an input 
array of numbers.
In case of textual data ,it is difficult to do so directly.
The core idea is that we need to express the text into numbers so that the meaning of the text gets displayed/is understood in the numbers.

When you add all the reviews of the dataset then it becomes a corpus.
all the unique words in dataset is vocabulary
every individual review is called document
each individual word of review is called word.

In bag of words and n-grams each word was having equal weightage,but in tf-idf each word will be assigned different weight.
If a word is very frequent in a particular sentence but is rare in the rest of the document(corpus),then that word becomes very important for the document D1.-that word 
given more score as compared to the other words.
To calculate that value,we use two terms-tf(trm frequency) and idf(inverse document frequency) and multiply them.
